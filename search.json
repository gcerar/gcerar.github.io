    "text": "Recent technological advances have transformed education, elevating the quality of teaching and learning. Jupyter Notebooks emerge as a leading tool for interactive computing, programming, and data analysis (Perkel 2018; Mendez et al. 2019; Granger et al. 2021). However, hardware limitations became a significant hurdle when handling larger research projects. While public cloud services are an option, they come with notable drawbacks. In response, we developed a private cloud solution for our lab using Kubernetes. This solution addresses cost and security concerns while ensuring adaptability. Through this technology, we have enabled efficient app management, scalability, and resource flexibility.\n\n\nA Jupyter Notebook is an open document format based on JSON1. Notebooks are organized into a sequence of cells, with each cell containing code, descriptive text, equations, and rich outputs (e.g., text displays, tables, audio, images, and animations). Tools like JupyterLab provide a platform for interactive code execution, data analysis, and documentation, all within a single interface, culminating in a Jupyter Notebook. These notebooks support various programming languages (e.g., Python, R, Scala, C++) and allow users to write and execute code cells iteratively (using REPL2 or WETL3 approaches), offering immediate visibility of intermediate results.

    "text": "Turnkey Solution?\nWhen planning the private cloud, we initially explored turnkey solutions, including NVIDIA DeepOps. Despite its advantages, we built our custom solution for the following reasons. While DeepOps is an excellent turnkey solution with maintained source code on GitHub and offers commercial support, initial setup requires configuration file adjustments, including Ansible scripts for automated (re)configuration of installed Linux distribution. Its complexity discouraged us, further investing our time into tinkering with it.\nOne of our biggest concerns was the intricate solution that tries to be versatile and “simple”. However, this inevitably leads to hiding functionalities and, in case of issues, jumping around documentation of multiple unrelated internally used tools. Despite proclaimed simplicity, troubleshooting or upgrade problems require manual intervention, where a thorough understanding of Linux, DeepOps, its internal tooling, and their interactions is necessary for system control. Therefore, we decided to start with a minimalist solution and, over time, plan to expand the system to understand the infrastructure’s operation better."

    "section": "Foundation Infrastructure",
    "text": "Foundation Infrastructure\nIn this section, we discuss the foundation infrastructure of our private cloud solution. We’ll go through these building blocks, including the selection of container management tools and resource sharing, which are vital for the operation of the Kubernetes platform.\nOperating System: We chose Ubuntu Server based on the Debian Linux distribution for our system. The advantage of widely used Debian-based Linux distributions is the abundance of available knowledge resources and support, making problem-solving more accessible. Among alternatives, like declarative binary reproducible NixOS and RHEL-based distributions, we also considered the Talos distribution specialized for Kubernetes. However, we preferred to stick with Ubuntu Server due to the Talos project’s novelty and associated risks.\nContainer Management: For container management, we selected ContainerD, also used in the DeepOps solution and officially supported by NVIDIA. It is an open-source tool that implements the CRI interface for communication between the operating system and Kubernetes for efficient and reliable container management.\nData Storage: For data storage, we chose ZFS, which resides on one of the nodes. Although solutions like HDFS, Gluster, Lustre, or Ceph are far more common in the HPC world, they require dedicated infrastructure and tools to offer features offered by ZFS out-of-the-box. Features include checkpoints, data deduplication, compression, a COW (copy-on-write) system to prevent data loss during writing, immunity to silent bit-rot, the ability to use disks as redundancy for mechanical failures, and the use of fast SSD devices as a cache. It also allows easy manual intervention in the event of incidents. However, at the time of writing, ZFS does not stretch across multiple nodes, posing a risk of cluster failure in case of a data-storing node’s malfunction (single point of failure). There is an ongoing effort to implement ZFS’ distributed RAID (dRAID) [src].\nTo access ZFS storage from Kubernetes, we used the NFS server, which is part of the Linux kernel. We chose NFS because it is one of the few methods that allow multiple containers to bind to the same mounting point (see table).\nSystem Management: For remote management and node configuration, we use Ansible maintained by Red Hat. We selected it due to its prevalence in other significant open-source projects and positive experiences from past projects."

    "section": "Kubernetes",
    "text": "Kubernetes\nIn Kubernetes, everything operates as a service. These services provide various functionalities that enhance Kubernetes capabilities, such as storage access, CPU and GPU allocation, traffic management, and connecting services within a mesh network.\nTo support specific functionalities, appropriate services (much like operating system drivers) must be installed. These specialized services, often called “operators” in Kubernetes terminology [src], are essential. They not only deploy and manage functionalities but also respond to issues. Operators enhance Kubernetes by interfacing with standardized and version-controlled APIs.\nPut simply, operators can be viewed as one or more Docker containers. They function as an intermediary layer, bridging the gap between the underlying operating system and Kubernetes APIs.\n\nInternal Services\nIn Kubernetes, internal services are not intended for end users but are crucial for the system’s operation. These services operate in the background, ensuring vital functionalities that enable the stable operation and management of the container environment. In this subsection, we will introduce key services within Kubernetes and explain their role in our infrastructure. We will describe each service’s primary functionality and examine alternatives we explored in making our decision.\nKubernetes Distribution: When choosing a Kubernetes distribution, we examined three options: Canonical MicroK8s, Red Hat OpenShift, and the basic “vanilla” Kubernetes distribution. “Vanilla” Kubernetes represents the unaltered version directly available in Google’s repository, without pre-installed applications or plugins. We went for the vanilla version as it provides flexibility and freedom of choice of the extensions.\nMicroK8s is an excellent solution for quick experimentation and setting up the system on smaller devices with limited resources (e.g., Raspberry Pi). However, it has many pre-installed applications and uses Canonical’s Snap packaging system, which can complicate adjusting configuration files and accessing external services, such as the NFS server.\nWe ruled out OpenShift due to the complexity of managing security profiles that, for our use case, were excessive, requiring substantial effort to implement these profiles for each service. Therefore, we opted for the basic “vanilla” Kubernetes distribution, offering more flexible and straightforward customization tailored to our needs.\nKubernetes Package Deployment: To describe the implementation of services in Kubernetes, a straightforward approach is to write YAML configuration file(s) (also called manifesto), which are then forwarded to Kubernetes via the command line. However, some services can be quite complex, leading developers to create service packages, making services more general-purpose and customizable through parameters. The most widespread packaging system is Helm, allowing for more portable and adaptable service packages. Helm uses YAML files as templates (much like forms), which are then filled out based on the provided parameters and sent to Kubernetes.\nNetwork Operator: Kubernetes services must be interconnected to communicate with other services. We opted for the open-source Tigera Calico operator to manage interconnections. Given its prevalence and functionalities, we found it the most suitable solution.\nCalico and Flannel are the most common solutions for network operators. Flannel is more minimalistic and operates as a network switch (layer 2) using technologies like Open vSwitch or VXLAN. In contrast, Calico routes traffic like a network router (layer 3). Especially in cases of multi-cluster (i.e., multiple physical locations) or hybrid cloud services, Calico emerges as a better choice.\nStorage Operator: For effective storage management within the Kubernetes system, we used csi-driver-nfs. It allows us to use the already established NFS servers. With it, we ensure uninterrupted access to persistent storage for any service within our private cloud.\nThe csi-driver-nfs proved most suitable since we already had an NFS server on one of the nodes. It allows us straightforward and centralized storage management for all services within Kubernetes. Centralization brings about numerous advantages, yet also challenges. Among the latter is the system’s vulnerability during a potential outage of the node storing the data. Nonetheless, centralization facilitates easier troubleshooting and backup execution.\nBare-Metal Ingress Load-Balancer: To ensure balanced ingress (of incoming) traffic among entry points in our Kubernetes cluster, we decided to utilize the MetalLB solution. After thorough research, we could not find any other alternative. Most of the online documentation (e.g., tutorials, blogs) focuses on setting up infrastructure on public clouds such as AWS or Azure and using solutions tailored to the demands of public cloud providers. However, since our infrastructure is based on our hardware (i.e., bare-metal), we opted for MetalLB, which has proven reliable and effective in routing traffic among our Kubernetes cluster’s entry points.\nIngress Operator: While a network operator manages interconnection between services within Kubernetes, the ingress operator manages access to services from the outside world. For security reasons, direct access to the internal network is prohibited. While it is possible to enter the internal network through a proxy (i.e., kubectl proxy), that’s meant only for debugging purposes. The ingress operator is designed to resolve domain names and route traffic to the correct container and port, which we described in the service’s YAML manifesto. Using domain name resolution has several advantages. Regardless of the service’s internal IP address, the ingress operator will always correctly direct traffic. The ingress operator can act as a load balancer when there is a high-traffic load, balancing traffic between multiple copies of service.\nAmong the most common solutions for ingress traffic management are NGINX and Traefik Ingress Operator. We chose NGINX, but the operators’ interface is standardized, so there are almost no differences between the solutions. Regardless of the selected solution, once a new service is deployed, the operator will follow the service’s manifesto and automatically route traffic to the appropriate container.\nGPU Operator: For efficient management of access to computing accelerators, we decided to use the official NVIDIA GPU-Operator suite of services. This suite provides two distinct installation options for NVIDIA drivers. The first option leverages host drivers, while the second involves drivers packaged within containers. Initially, we opted for the first option, wanting to enable the use of accelerators outside the Kubernetes framework. However, due to issues with conflicting driver versions, we decided to utilize the drivers provided by the GPU-Operator.\n\n\nUser Services\nIn this section, we introduce the selected services available to end users of our private cloud, enabling efficient execution and management of their research and educational projects.\nJupyterHub represents one of the key services in our private cloud, providing users with easy access to computing resources, data, and Jupyter notebooks for research and teaching purposes. To implement JupyterHub, we use the Z2JH (Zero-to-JupyterHub) implementation, developed by a team of researchers at the University of Berkeley in collaboration with the Jupyter community. This solution facilitates quick setup and maintenance.\nEvery individual user is granted access to an isolated container instance via their username and password or OAuth provider, such as GitHub, Google, or OAuth0. An isolated instance offers a stripped-down Linux environment with limited internet access and without admin permissions. Kubernetes then ensures access to shared data resources, common directories, and the use of computational accelerators.\nThe JupyterHub user interface is similar to Google Colab or Kaggle services. Upon entering the isolated instance, JupyterLab is already running, and the user also has access to the Linux terminal. Additional tools and software packages can be installed using pip, conda, or mamba commands.\nGrafana is a key service in our private cloud, facilitating a straightforward display of the current workload of the compute cluster and the availability of computational accelerators. This data visualization platform allows users to present information clearly and transparently, aiding them in making decisions regarding resource usage and optimizing their tasks. Utilizing Grafana ensures efficient and transparent resource monitoring, enhancing user experience. Data collection (Prometheus) and visualization (Grafana) are deployed by kube-prometheus-stack."

Specifically, we went for the F-series, which has higher base and turbo frequencies — up to 4.0GHz — at the cost of fewer cores. We picked a CPU with the highest available TDP of 280W. We installed server-grade registered error-correcting memory at the highest frequency supported by the processor and populated all eight channels on both processors. Sixteen sticks of RAM in total. Although we considered solutions from Intel, AMD EPYC processors had better price-to-performance ratios.\nFrom the perspective of numerical performance, our significant concern was Intel-optimized libraries, such as Intel MKL, often found in numerical tools. The library has a “bug” that causes non-Intel processors to utilize a slower SSE instead of more advanced AVX vectorization instructions [src]. OpenBLAS is a good alternative but requires some effort to install it. See Anaconda no-mkl package.\nWe chose two NVMe drives configured in the mirror configuration (RAID-1) for the system drive. We selected six 8TB SSD SATA drives configured in ZFS RAID-Z1 for data storage, which has one drive redundancy. We also chose two A100 GPUs as accelerators.\nNVIDIA A100 GPUs come in two form factors: PCI-E and SXM4. The SXM4 proprietary form factor has a higher TDP and high-bandwidth NVLink interconnections between every GPU through NVSwitch hardware. The downside of SXM4 is that it will only support Ampere generation GPUs and require a special motherboard. The PCI-E variant has a lower TDP, and NVLink can only be across two GPUs. However, we decided against vendor lock-in, limiting ourselves to one brand and generation, and went with the PCI-E variant.\nWe considered the most likely workflow scenarios. We expected most communication to be CPU-to-GPU, with GPUs sliced into several instances. Once GPU slicing is enabled, the NVIDIA drivers disable NVLink, rendering NVLink connections useless. We can change GPU slicing strategy freely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The computing node on my desk underwent final checks before being installed in the server rack."

During this period, users were informed that we might reboot the system or make significant changes without responsibility for any potential data loss, though we aimed to minimize such occurrences.\nWe made two key decisions about resource allocation. Users can utilize all available memory and CPU cores. When CPU demand is high, Kubernetes and the operating system manage the scheduling of tasks. In cases of high memory usage, the job consuming the most memory is terminated to protect other running tasks.\nFeedback from students and researchers was overwhelmingly positive, highlighting the high speed, numerous cores, ample memory, and dedicated GPU access without interference.\nDuring the testing phase, “testers” identified several issues, which were promptly addressed. These included adding a shared folder with datasets and Jupyter notebooks, shared package cache, and better persistence of running tasks in JupyterLab.\n\nJupyterHub\nJupyterHub has become a crucial component of our research infrastructure, enhancing our workflow significantly.

    "text": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are an innovative class of unsupervised neural networks that have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence. They were first introduced in Generative Adversarial Networks (Goodfellow et al. 2014) and consist of two separate neural networks: the generator (creates data) and the discriminator (evaluates data authenticity). The generator aims to fool the discriminator by producing realistic data, while the discriminator tries to differentiate real from fake. Over iterations, the generator’s data becomes more convincing.\nAs an analogy, consider two kids, one drawing counterfeit money (“Generator”) and another assessing its realism (“Discriminator”). Over time, the counterfeit drawings become increasingly convincing."

This technique became a hit due to its novel outcomes, leading to its adoption in various apps and platforms and highlighting deep learning’s prowess in image transformation.\nIntroduced initially in “A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style” (Gatys, Ecker, and Bethge 2015), this method transfers art styles between images.

    "section": "Loss metrics",
    "text": "Loss metrics\nTo effectively implement Neural Style Transfer, we need to quantify how well the generated image matches both the content and style of our source images. This is done using loss metrics. Let’s delve into the specifics of these metrics and how they drive the NST process.\n\nContent loss metric\nContent loss is calculated through Euclidean distance (i.e., mean squared error) between the respective intermediate higher-level feature representation \\(F^l\\) and \\(P^l\\) of original input image \\(\\vec{x}\\) and the content image \\(\\vec{p}\\) at layer \\(l\\).\nHence, a given input image \\(\\vec{x}\\) is encoded in each layer of the CNN by the filter responses to that image. A layer with \\(N_l\\) distinct filters has \\(N_l\\) feature maps of size \\(M_l\\), where \\(M_l\\) is the height times the width of the feature map. So the response in a layer \\(l\\) can be stored in a matrix \\(F^l \\in \\mathcal{R}^{N_l \\times M_l}\\) where \\(F_{ij}^{l}\\) is the activation of the \\(i^{th}\\) filter at position \\(j\\) in layer \\(l\\).\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}_{content}(\\vec{p}, \\vec{x}, l) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i,j} (F^{l}_{ij} - P^{l}_{ij})^2\n\\]\n\ndef content_loss_func(target_features: dict[str, Tensor], precomputed_content_features: dict[str, Tensor]) -&gt; Tensor:\n    \"\"\"Calculate content loss metric for give layers.\"\"\"\n\n    device = next(iter(target_features.values())).device\n    content_loss = torch.tensor(0.0, device=device)\n\n    for layer in precomputed_content_features:\n        target_feature = target_features[layer]\n        content_feature = precomputed_content_features[layer]\n\n        content_loss += F.mse_loss(target_feature, content_feature)\n\n    return content_loss\n\n\n\nStyle loss\nThe style loss is more convolved than the content loss. We compute it by comparing the Gram matrices of the feature maps from the style image and the generated image.\nFirst, let’s understand the Gram matrix. Given the feature map \\(F\\) of size \\(C \\times (H \\times W)\\), where \\(C\\) is the number of channels and \\(H \\times W\\) are the spatial dimensions, the Gram matrix \\(G\\) is of size \\(C \\times C\\) and is computed as\n\\[\nG^l_{ij} = \\sum_k F^l_{ik} F^l_{jk}\n\\]\nwhere \\(G_{ij}\\) is the inner product between vectorized feature maps \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). This results in a matrix that captures the correlation between different feature maps and, thus, the style information.\n\ndef gram_matrix(input: Tensor) -&gt; Tensor:\n    (b, c, h, w) = input.size()\n\n    # reshape into (C x (H x W))\n    features = input.view(b * c, h * w)\n\n    # compute the gram product\n    gram = torch.mm(features, features.t())\n\n    return gram\n\nThe style loss between the Gram matrix of the generated image \\(G\\) and that of style image \\(A\\) (at a specific layer \\(l\\)) is:\n\\[\nE_l = \\frac{1}{4 N^{2}_{l} M^{2}_{l}} \\sum_{i,j}(G^l_{ij} - A^l_{ij})^2\n\\]\nWhere \\(E_l\\) is the style loss for layer \\(l\\), \\(N_l\\) and \\(M_l\\) are the numbers of channels and height times width in the feature representation of layer \\(l\\), respectively. \\(G_{ij}^l\\) and \\(A_{ij}^l\\) are the gram matrices of the intermediate representation of the style image \\(\\vec{a}\\) and the input base image \\(\\vec{x}\\) respectively.\nThe total style loss is:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}_{style}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{x}) = \\sum_{l=0}^{L} w_l E_l\n\\]\n\ndef style_loss_func(\n    target_features: dict[str, Tensor], style_features: dict[str, Tensor], precomputed_style_grams: dict[str, Tensor]\n) -&gt; Tensor:\n    device = next(iter(target_features.values())).device\n    style_loss = torch.tensor(0.0, device=device)\n\n    for layer in style_features:\n        target_feature = target_features[layer]\n        target_gram = gram_matrix(target_feature)\n\n        style_gram = precomputed_style_grams[layer]\n\n        _, c, h, w = target_feature.shape\n\n        weight = STYLE_LAYERS_DEFAULT[layer]\n        layer_style_loss = weight * F.mse_loss(target_gram, style_gram) / (c * h * w)\n        style_loss += layer_style_loss\n\n    return style_loss\n\n\n\nTotal Variation Loss\nTotal Variation (TV) loss, also known as Total Variation Regularization, is commonly added to the Neural Style Transfer objective to encourage spatial smoothness in the generated image. Without it, the output might exhibit noise or oscillations, particularly in regions where the content and style objectives don’t offer much guidance.\nGiven an image \\(\\vec{x}\\) of size \\(H \\times W \\times C\\) (height, width, channels), the Total Variation loss is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between neighboring pixel values:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}_{TV}(\\vec{x}) = \\sum_{i,j} ((x_{i,j+1} - x_{i,j})^2 + (x_{i+1,j} - x_{i,j})^2)\n\\]\nwhere \\(x_{i,j}\\) is the pixel value at position \\((i,j)\\).\nIn simple terms, this loss penalizes abrupt changes in pixel values from one to its neighbors. By minimizing this loss, the generated image becomes smoother, reducing artifacts and unwanted noise. When combined with content and style losses, the TV loss ensures that the resulting image not only captures the content and style of the source images but also looks visually coherent and smooth.\n\ndef total_variance_loss_func(target: Tensor) -&gt; Tensor:\n    tv_loss = F.l1_loss(target[:, :, :, :-1], target[:, :, :, 1:]) + F.l1_loss(\n        target[:, :, :-1, :], target[:, :, 1:, :]\n    )\n\n    return tv_loss\n\n\n\nTotal Loss\nThe total loss combines three loss metric components, each targeting a specific aspect of the image generation process. Let’s recap the components:\n\nContent Loss: Ensures the generated image resembles the content image’s content.\nStyle Loss: Ensures the generated image captures the stylistic features of the style image.\nTotal Variation Loss: Encourages spatial smoothness in the generated image, reducing artifacts and noise.\n\nGiven the above components, the total loss \\(\\mathcal{L}_{total}\\) for Neural Style Transfer can be formulated as:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}_{total}(\\vec{p},\\vec{a},\\vec{x}) = \\alpha\\mathcal{L}_{content}(\\vec{p},\\vec{x}) + \\beta\\mathcal{L}_{style}(\\vec{a},\\vec{x}) + \\gamma\\mathcal{L}_{TV}(\\vec{x})\n\\]\n\\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\gamma\\) are weight factors that determine the relative importance of the content, style, and the total variation losses, respectively. By adjusting these weights, one can control the balance between content preservation, style transfer intensity, and the smoothness of the generated image. The algorithm aims to adjust the generated image to minimize the total loss."

Note that we set the model to evaluation mode, ensuring we only use VGG19 to extract features without altering its weights. We also transfer the neural network (NN) to a chosen device, ideally a GPU, for optimal performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAn intriguing choice by Gatys et al. was to modify VGG-19, replacing max pooling with average pooling, aiming for visually superior results. However, a challenge arises: our NN was initially trained with MaxPool2d layers. Substituting them can affect activations due to reduced output values. To counteract this, we’ve introduced a custom ScaledAvgPool2d.\n\n\n\n# We will use a frozen pre-trained VGG neural network for feature extraction.\n# In the original paper, authors have used VGG19 (without batch normalization)\nmodel = models.vgg19(weights=models.VGG19_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1).features\n\n\n# Authors in the original paper suggested using AvgPool instead of MaxPool\n# for more pleasing results.

For effective style transfer, we’ll follow suit to improve feature extraction. Though images will appear altered post-normalization, they are reverted to their original state after the NST process. Next, we’ll transform the content and style images by:\n\nLoading them from storage.\nResizing while maintaining aspect ratio.\nConverting to tensors.\nNormalizing using ImageNet weights.\n\n\n# ImageNet normalization weights per channel\nIMAGENET_MEAN = (0.485, 0.456, 0.406)\nIMAGENET_STD = (0.229, 0.224, 0.225)\n\ntransform = T.Compose(\n    [\n        T.ToImage(),\n        T.Resize(IMG_SIZE),  # Shorter edge of the image will be matched to `IMG_SIZE`\n        T.ToDtype(torch.float32, scale=True),\n        T.Normalize(IMAGENET_MEAN, IMAGENET_STD),\n    ]\n)\n\n\ndef load_image(path: str | Path) -&gt; Tensor:\n    img = decode_image(str(path))\n\n    # Transform images into tensors\n    img: Tensor = transform(img)\n\n    # Add dimension to imitate batch size equal to 1: (C,H,W) -&gt; (B,C,H,W)\n    img = img.unsqueeze(0)\n    return img\n\nThe following code will prepares content \\(\\vec{p}\\), style \\(\\vec{a}\\), and target \\(\\vec{x}\\) images. The target image is a clone of the content image and we enable computation of gradients on it.\n\n# The \"style\" image from which we obtain style\nstyle = load_image(style_path).to(device)\n\n# The \"content\" image on which we apply style\ncontent = load_image(content_path).to(device)\n\n# The \"target\" image to store the outcome\ntarget = content.clone().requires_grad_(True).to(device)\n\nThe function below retrieves feature maps from designated layers. As shown in Figure 1:\n\nContent feature map comes from relu5_2.\nStyle feature maps are sourced from relu1_1, relu2_1, relu3_1, relu4_1, and relu5_1.\n\n\ndef get_features(image: Tensor, model: nn.Module, layers: Iterable[str] | None = None) -&gt; dict[str, Tensor]:\n    if layers is None:\n        layers = tuple(STYLE_LAYERS_DEFAULT.keys()) + CONTENT_LAYERS_DEFAULT\n\n    features = {}\n    block_num = 1\n    conv_num = 0\n\n    x = image\n\n    for layer in model.children():\n        x = layer(x)\n\n        if isinstance(layer, nn.Conv2d):\n            # produce layer name to find matching convolutions from the paper\n            # and store their output for further processing.\n            conv_num += 1\n            name = f\"conv{block_num}_{conv_num}\"\n            if name in layers:\n                features[name] = x\n\n        elif isinstance(layer, nn.MaxPool2d | nn.AvgPool2d | ScaledAvgPool2d):\n            # In VGG, each block ends with max/avg pooling layer.\n            block_num += 1\n            conv_num = 0\n\n        elif isinstance(layer, nn.BatchNorm2d | nn.ReLU):\n            pass\n\n        else:\n            raise Exception(f\"Unknown layer: {layer}\")\n\n    return features\n\nSince content and style images never change, we can precompute their feature maps and grams to speed up the NST process.\n\n# Precompute content features, style features, and style gram matrices.\ncontent_features = get_features(content, model, CONTENT_LAYERS_DEFAULT)\nstyle_features = get_features(style, model, STYLE_LAYERS_DEFAULT)\n\nstyle_grams = {layer: gram_matrix(style_features[layer]) for layer in style_features}\n\nNext, we will use Adam optimizer, where we specify that only target image \\(\\vec{x}\\) is considered for optimization.\n\noptimizer = optim.Adam([target], lr=LEARNING_RATE)\n\nThe final step of NST is to transfer style using everything we’ve implemented. We extract feature maps, compute total loss, perform steps using gradient descent, and repeat the process N_EPOCHS times. Gradient changes will apply only to the target image.\nTo notably enhance NST speed, I utilized mixed precision with the unique bfloat16 found in newer hardware. Traditional half-precision float16 doesn’t yield the same results. I’ve tested it.

A feature map (also called an activation map) is simply the tensor that a layer outputs (for example, output = conv(input)). During training, each convolutional layer learns a set of spatial kernels that act as filters (see kernels in image processing), allowing the network to draw ever‑richer patterns from the feature maps produced by the preceding layers.\n\nfor layer, filters in vgg_activations.items():\n    display(Markdown(f\"### Layer #{layer}\"))\n    visualize_feature_maps(filters, max_maps=8 * 8, norm=\"linear\")\n    plt.show()\n\nLayer #0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayer #3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayer #6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayer #8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayer #11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayer #13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayer #16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayer #18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove, we noted that the number of visualizations grows with the number of filters. A large number of filters can be overwhelming when a layer produces dozens of maps. To condense this information, we can project the feature maps with principal‑component analysis (PCA). We treat each spatial position across all maps as a feature vector, run PCA, and then reconstruct the dominant components. The result is a single “average” activation image that captures the most salient variance across the entire stack of feature maps. It can be rendered in either 1‑channel (grayscale) or 3‑channel (RGB) form.\n\nvisualize_feature_maps_pca(vgg_activations, max_cols=4)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nPrincipal‑component projections of the feature‑map stacks for the corresponding layers of VGG‑11."

These visualizations offer an intuitive window into what a convolutional network attends to at each processing stage.\nFor deeper, production‑grade interpretability, explore the rich ecosystem of explainability libraries and frameworks, such as Captum or SHAP, and take a broader look at the rapidly growing fields of eXplainable AI (XAI) and Responsible AI.\n\nCaptum\nSHAP"

    "text": "Hi 🖐️! I’m Gregor (Greg for short). I’m a Research & Innovation Engineer at Comsensus and a Postdoc / Professional Research Fellow at Jožef Stefan Institute, working with SensorLab.\nMost of my time, I work as a generalist Python developer. I write software for backend services, tools for interacting with hardware, and task automation. I occasionally work on AI tasks and deal with Linux, containers, Kubernetes and related tooling. I used to write embedded C and JavaScript, but now it’s mostly Python.\nI’m into self-supervised learning, time-series analysis, and smart infrastructure. I hold a PhD in ICT, where I focused on wireless communication and AI.\nBeyond work, I enjoy the quiet side of life. I like writing clean Python code, diving deep into research that interests me, and spending time outdoors hiking. I also enjoy playing chess and the classic “Uno!” card game.\nThanks for stopping by!"
